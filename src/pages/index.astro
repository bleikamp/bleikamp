      <h4>Now</h4>
      <p>
        Right now I'm a co-founder at Cased. We're working with language models
        and AI to build tools for DevOps teams.
      </p>
      <h4>Meta, 2017-2018</h4>
      <p>
        I lead the team building design tools and infrastructure. We were
        responsible for <a href="https://origami.design">Origami Studio</a> as well
        internal tools for distributing and maintaining design systems, collecting
        feedback on design work, and improving collaboration across product teams.
      </p>
      <h4>GitHub, 2011-2017</h4>
      <p>
        I joined as one of the first product designers. From 2014-2016 I led the
        design team as Director of Product Design and in 2017 I helped start the
        product management team as Director of Product.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at GitHub I led design and product for areas like mobile,
        organizations, security, and enterprise.
      </p>
      <h4>Yelp, Bleacher Report, etc. 2007-2011</h4>
      <p>
        I've also worked at Yelp as an early product manager and was the first
        designer hired at Bleacher Report. In college I built WordPress sites
        for people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss"
          >Tim Ferriss</a
        > and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramit_Sethi">Ramit Sethi</a>.
