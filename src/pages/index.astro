<Layout title="ben bleikamp Â· software designer">
  <p>
    I'm a professional software designer, amateur programmer, and co-founder at <a
      href="https://cased.com">Cased</a
    >.
  </p>
  <h3>Work</h3>
  <p>
    I joined GitHub in 2011 as one of the firt product designers. 
    I ended up leading the design team as Director of Product
    Design and then started the product management team as Director of Product.
  </p>
  <p>
    I joined Meta in 2017 to lead a team building design tools
    and infrastructure. The team is responsible for <a
      href="https://origami.design">Origami Studio</a
    > as well internal tools for distributing design systems and collecting feedback on design work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before all that I worked at Yelp as an early product manager and was the
    first designer hired at Bleacher Report. In college I
    built WordPress sites for people like <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss">Tim Ferriss</a
    > and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramit_Sethi">Ramit Sethi</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now I'm a co-founder at Cased and I write small angel checks to
    founders who are building new tools.
